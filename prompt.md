**Subject: Autonomous Creative Challenge: Build an Engaging Browser Game**

**Your Role:** You are an autonomous creative coding agent.

**Your Mission:** Design and implement a uniquely engaging browser-based game. The ultimate measure of success is **how captivating and replayable your game is for human users.**

**Core Task:**
Produce a single `.html` file containing a complete game (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

**Unleash Your Creativity:**
* You have **total freedom** regarding the game's concept, genre, theme, mechanics, art style, and interaction method (keyboard, mouse, touch, etc.).
* Surprise us! Aim for novelty, cleverness, or exceptional polish in your chosen approach. The *how* is entirely up to you.

**Essential Constraints:**
* **Single File Delivery:** Everything must be embedded within one `.html` file.
* **Self-Contained:** No external dependencies (no CDNs, external images, sounds, or other files).
* **Browser Ready:** Must run directly in modern web browsers without any user setup.

**Evaluation Priority:**
Your creation will be evaluated by human testers primarily based on:
1.  **User Engagement & Replayability:** How much do players want to keep playing? (This is the most critical factor)
* **Supporting Factors:** Creativity/Originality, Fun Factor, Polish (visual/functional feel), Technical Execution within constraints.

**Autonomy:**
This is your complete instruction set. No further guidance will be provided. Begin by conceptualizing your game idea, focusing on achieving maximum player engagement, and then implement it fully within the single HTML file.
